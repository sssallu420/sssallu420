CHARON project for preserving and storing of e-health Big Data.

CHARON is a user-space file system implemented using FUSE-J, a Java wrapper for the FUSE library.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Software Requirements=
O/S                  	 :  Windows XP.
Language	      	 :  Java.
IDE                   	 :  Net Beans (latest version)
Data Base	       	 :  MySQL using WAMP server
Hardware Requirements-:Can be implemented in Windows or Ubuntu OS.(Windows most preferrable)

SETUP

1.Import the charon file containing all java files and other files.
2.In that Charon file, open fault tolerant folder and paste it under directory in form of C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.1.36\data\fault_tolerant. This is important step for storing the data in mysql database.
3.We can either use BoxSync cloud is also used because its an open source software that provides free cloud storage for big data files but here, for storing dataset in cloud. But this may be negotiated since the entire system can be used as cloud.
4.Finally, check the entire files for errors by debugging and then run index file first and then cloud server login for further working of project.
